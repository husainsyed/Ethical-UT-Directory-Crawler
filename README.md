# Ethical-UT-Directory-Crawler
[Beta Version]:
A Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup4 library to extract all the available information regarding a UT-affiliated member through the
UT Directory website. The script allows one to extract the information of multiple people at once - just fill in the text file with first and last name
of the person and run the script. The attached CSV file named names_emails.csv will automatically update.
